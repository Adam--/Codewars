This is a collection of my solutions to some of my favorite codewars.com challenges/katas in C#.

Katas are small programming challenges intended to strengthen your programming skills.

Ranks are in decreasing order from easiest to hardest. Everyone starts out at rank 8 kyu. As challenges are completed your rank number decreases: 8 kyu > 7 kyu > 6 kyu > 5 kyu ... 1 kyu.
